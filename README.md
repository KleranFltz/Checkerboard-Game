# Checkerboard-Game

This program uses pygame to display to bots playing eachother in a game of snakes and ladders.

Each square is numbered, and the current roll of the player is displayed beneath the board.

There are two players each with their own colour.

There is only one snake on the second last square in order to avoid the game going on forever (since the minimum roll is 2 and you cannot pass the end
of the board)
